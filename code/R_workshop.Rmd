# General Overview of R

## History of R

* R is a programming language which was created in 1991 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman.

* It was created originally for data analysis and graphics, and documented in this puplished paper: 
 
> Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. R: A language for data analysis and graphics. Journal of   Computational and Graphical Statistics, 5(3):299–314, 1996  
  <http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/JeffreyHorner/JCGSR.pdf>

* Martin Mächler in 1995 convinced the creators of R to use the GNU General Public License to make R free software.

* In 2000 R version 1.0.0 was released to the public.

* R has remained an open source software till today with a great online community of users and support.

## How Popular is R as a Programming Language?

# R Studio

* It is an integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.

### Project Management

* We will thtough an example of how to properly manage your research project to make your life easy!

## Basic R To Know!

### Data types

It is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. The primitive data types are:

* character: "a", "swc"
* numeric: 2, 15.5
* integer: 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)
* blogical: TRUE, FALSE
* complex: 1+4i (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts

Functions to check to examnine attributes of data types

* class() - what kind of object is it (high-level)?
* typeof() - what is the object’s data type (low-level)?
* length() - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
* attributes() - does it have any metadata?

```{r}
x <- "Eric"
class(x)
```
### Function
Provides a means to work on a data object: Select, transform, filter and many more

```{r}
addnumbers <- function(x, y){
  sum <- x +y
  return(sum)
}

addnumbers(2,5)
```
### Control Mechanism

```{r}
if (1 >3){
  print("yes")
}else {
  print("No")
}

```


### Installing Packages

* A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others

* We are going to work with the tidyverse package for data analysis.

* We use the install.packages("package") to install and library("package") to activate it.

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```


## Tidyverse

* The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.

Let's check its website: < https://www.tidyverse.org/>

* It uses the pipes (%>%) to chain a series of related activities together.

### Packages within tidyverse

* ggplot2 : is a system for declaratively creating graphics
* dplyr : provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that           solve the most common data manipulation challenges
* readr : provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data
* tidymodels : provide a comprehensive foundation for creating and using models of all                     types
* purr and many others...
